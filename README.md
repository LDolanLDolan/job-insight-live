## Methodological Approach:

Our analysis employs statistical methodologies to examine gender distribution patterns. The 2021 Census data provides unprecedented granularity, capturing nuanced demographic shifts that have occurred over the past decade, including evolving perspectives on gender identity and expression.

## Data Integrity and Scope:

The analysis leverages official ONS (Office for National Statistics) microdata, ensuring the highest standards of statistical reliability and representativeness.


## Visual Outputs

This project produces two visual charts:

1. ðŸ“Š **Bar chart** (`gender_identity_histogram_log.png`)  
   - Compares gender identity categories across different local authorities
   - Uses a log scale to highlight smaller identity groups
   - Shown by default when running the script

2. ðŸ¥§ **Pie chart** (`gender_identity_pie_chart.png`)  
   - Shows the overall distribution of gender identity responses across all areas
   - Saved silently in Python, but displayed automatically in Jupyter Notebooks
